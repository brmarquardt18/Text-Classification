# classificationAnalysis
In this file I will look at a large data set of movie reviews that are classified based on sentiment into 5 classes a 0,1,2,3, or 4 with 0 being most negative and 4 being most positive. I will then create a model and test it out while looking at the distribution of sentiments.

This file was really a learning process for me. In this file I explore dealing with keras for the first time and walk myself through how to create a classification model on a dataset of movie reviews but with only two classes, a 0 as negative and 1 as positive. After I figure out and describe how to do this, I create many more models to test them out.
